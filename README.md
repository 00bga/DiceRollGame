Welcome to a two player Dice Roll Game!

How To Play:

1. Each player is given an option to roll the dice. (Player 1 rolls first).
2. When a player rolls the dice(by clicking the "Roll the Dice" button) the number rolled is added to their Current score.
3. If a player rolls a "one", they lose all their current score and a second player gets a turn to roll.
4. If a player chooses to hold their current score(by clicking the "Hold" button), their current score is added to their actual Score (secured), which then can not be lost.
Then a second player gets a turn to roll.
5. Whoever reaches the Score 50 first is the Winner!

Have Fun!
